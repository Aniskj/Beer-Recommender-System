# Beer-Recommender-System
Building a Crowdsourced Recommender System

### Objective
To build a crowdsourced beer recommender system using web-scraped reviews and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer sentiment and preferences.

### Business Objective
To provide personalized beer recommendations based on user reviews, enhancing customer satisfaction and driving sales by leveraging insights from large volumes of unstructured data.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset includes:
- Reviews extracted from various beer-related websites such as BeerAdvocate.
- Approximately 5-6k reviews covering popular, worst, top-rated, and trending beers.

### Analysis Approach
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Web scraping using Selenium to extract reviews from multiple beer-related websites.
   - Targeted URLs include popular, worst, top-rated, fame, top-styles, and trending beer pages on BeerAdvocate.

2. **Preprocessing and NLP**:
   - Tokenization, stop words removal, and frequency distribution analysis using NLTK.
   - Sentiment analysis using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner).
   - POS (Part-of-Speech) tagging and text cleaning to prepare data for analysis.

3. **Feature Extraction and Similarity Calculation**:
   - CountVectorizer to convert text data into a matrix of token counts.
   - Cosine similarity to measure the similarity between different beer reviews based on extracted features.

4. **Recommender System Development**:
   - Building a recommendation engine using similarity scores to suggest beers based on user preferences.
   - Post-processing to refine recommendations and ensure relevance.

### Insights
1. **Popular Beers**:
   - Identified beers with high positive sentiment and frequent mentions in reviews.
   - Popular beers are characterized by their unique flavors, high-quality ingredients, and overall positive customer experiences.

2. **Common Criticisms**:
   - Extracted negative sentiment to highlight common issues such as taste, packaging, and price.
   - Useful for brewers to understand areas for improvement and address customer concerns.

3. **Customer Preferences**:
   - Analysis of keywords and sentiment revealed common preferences for certain beer styles, flavors, and brands.
   - Insights into what drives customer satisfaction and repeat purchases.

### Recommendations
1. **Enhance Customer Experience**:
   - Use insights from positive reviews to highlight popular beers in marketing campaigns.
   - Address common criticisms by improving product quality and addressing customer concerns directly.

2. **Personalized Recommendations**:
   - Implement the recommender system on beer retail websites to provide personalized suggestions to customers.
   - Tailor recommendations based on individual preferences and past purchase history.

3. **Expand Data Sources**:
   - Continue to collect reviews from additional sources such as social media, forums, and other review platforms.
   - Integrate more diverse datasets to improve the robustness and accuracy of the recommender system.

4. **Refine NLP Models**:
   - Experiment with different NLP models and techniques to enhance sentiment analysis and feature extraction.
   - Continuously fine-tune models based on new data and evolving customer preferences.

### Future Scope for Improvement
- **Increase Dataset Size**: Continuously update the dataset with new reviews to capture changing customer preferences.
- **Incorporate Advanced NLP Techniques**: Explore advanced models like BERT or GPT for deeper sentiment analysis and understanding of contextual nuances in reviews.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Develop real-time data collection and analysis capabilities to provide up-to-date recommendations.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Collect and integrate user feedback on recommendations to continuously improve the recommender system's accuracy and relevance.

These insights and recommendations will help in developing a more effective beer recommender system, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and driving business growth.
